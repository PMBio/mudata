v0.3.0

This version adds support for `AnnData v0.10.0`.

v0.2.2
------

Path objects ``pathlib.Path`` now work in :func:`mudata.read`.

v0.2.1
------

This version comes with :func:`mudata.MuData.update` improvements and optimisations.

There is now :func:`mudata.MuData.__len__`. This should make it easier to build MuData into workflows that operate on data containers with length. In practice using :func:`mudata.MuData.n_obs` should be preferred.

In this implementation of MuData, default ``dict`` has replaced ``OrderedDict``, e.g. in the ``.uns`` slot, to improve compatibility with new serialisation versions. As of Python 3.6, dictionaries are insertion-ordered.

v0.2.0
------

This version uses new I/O serialisation of `AnnData v0.8 <https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/release-notes/index.html#th-march-2022>`_.

Updating a MuData object with :func:`mudata.MuData.update` is even faster in many use cases.

There's `a new axes interface <https://github.com/scverse/mudata/blob/master/docs/source/notebooks/axes.ipynb>`_ that allows to use MuData objects as containers with different shared dimensions.


v0.1.2
------

Updating a MuData object with :func:`mudata.MuData.update` is now much faster.

This version also comes with an improved documentation, including `a new page describing the sharp bits <notebooks/nuances.ipynb>`__.

v0.1.1
------

This version comes with improved stability and bug fixes.

v0.1.0
------

Initial ``mudata`` release with ``MuData`` (:class:`mudata.MuData`), previously a part of the ``muon`` framework.
